## Debian 6/7 VPS Script

Remove excess packages (apache2, sendmail, bind9, samba, nscd, etc) and install the basic components needed for a light-weight HTTP(S) web server:

 - dropbear (SSH)
 - iptables (firewall)
 - dash (replaces bash)
 - syslogd
 - MySQL (v5.5+ without Innodb, configured for lowend VPS)
 - PHP-FPM (v5.3+ with APC installed and configured)
 - exim4 (light mail server)
 - nginx (v1.2+ from dotdeb, configured for lowend VPS. Change worker_processes in nginx.conf according to number of CPUs)
 - vim, nano, mc, htop, iftop & iotop

Includes sample nginx config files for PHP sites. You can create a basic site shell (complete with nginx vhost) like this:

	./setup-debian.sh site example.com

When running the iptables or dropbear install you must specify a SSH port. Remember, port 22 is the default. It's recommended that you change this from 22 just to save server load from attacks on that port.

## Usage (in recommended order)

### Warning! This script will overwrite previous configs during reinstallation.

## After installation

- MySQL root is given a new password which is located in ~root/.my.cnf.
- After installing the full set, RAM usage reaches ~40-45MB.
By default APC configured to use 32MB for caching.
To reduce ram usage, you may disable APC by moving or deleting the following file - /etc/php5/conf.d/apc.ini
- I recommend installing Ajenti and/or Webmin to manage your VPS.
- For security reasons delete, move or password protect "[domain.tld]/public/phpinfo.php" file, which installed automatically on each new site installation.
